This project use an ESP32 in PIO-Arduino environnement to provide 4 pwm level for Volume, balance, bass, treeble control. 
It is drived by a pushbuton encoder and an IR remote control receptor. 
It use the OTA capability to update the firmware by the wifi connection.
The same project was build in micropython, but it wasn't sufisament fast to manage rotating encoder.
